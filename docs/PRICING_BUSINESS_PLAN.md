## 13. Conclusion & Recommendation

### Summary

**Investment Required:** $111-161 + 4 weeks time
**Expected Return:** $15K-25K year 1, $10K-15K/year ongoing
**Risk Level:** Low (validated model, low costs)
**Confidence:** High (85%)

### Recommendation: **PROCEED** ✅

**Why:**
1. Legal research confirms BYOK model is viable and proven
2. Prototype demonstrates technical feasibility
3. Market exists (2M+ self-published authors in US)
4. Competition is weak (expensive or poor UX)
5. Low risk, high potential return
6. Worst case: $10K passive income
7. Best case: $60K+ year 1, potential acquisition

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete full app development (4 weeks)
2. Beta test (20-30 users, 1 week)
3. Launch on Product Hunt + Mac App Store
4. Monitor metrics and iterate

**Decision:** Build it. Launch it. Learn from it.

Even if it only makes $12K in year 1, that's excellent ROI for a 4-week project. And the upside potential is significant if it takes off.
