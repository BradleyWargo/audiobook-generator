## Launch Announcement Templates

### Product Hunt Post:

**Tagline:** "Turn ebooks into audiobooks for $5 instead of $2,000"

**Description:**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built Audiobook Generator to solve a problem I had as a self-published author: audiobook narration costs thousands of dollars.

💡 THE IDEA
What if you could use Google Cloud's amazing TTS voices to create audiobooks at cost? No middleman, no markup, just you + Google Cloud.

🎧 WHAT IT DOES
• Converts EPUB & DOCX files to high-quality audiobooks
• 100+ voices in 40+ languages (Google Chirp3-HD)
• Chapter-by-chapter selection (skip intros, appendices, etc.)
• Real-time cost estimation
• Native Mac app (no web dashboard needed)

💰 PRICING
• App: $39.99 one-time purchase
• Google Cloud: ~$5-20 per book (you use your own account)
• Total: ~$45-60 for your first book

Compare that to $2,000-4,000 for professional narration!

🔐 PRIVACY
Your content goes to YOUR Google Cloud account. I never see your data. Complete transparency and control.

### Reddit r/selfpublish Post:

**Title:** "I built a tool to create audiobooks for $5 instead of $2,000 (using Google Cloud TTS)"

**Post:**
```
Hey fellow self-publishers,

I recently self-published my first novel and wanted to create an audiobook version. Every narrator I contacted quoted $2,000-4,000.

So I built an app that uses Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API to convert ebooks to audiobooks automatically.

**Cost breakdown:**
- My app: $39.99 (one-time)
- Google Cloud API: ~$5-8 per typical novel
- Total: ~$45-48 per book

**What it does:**
- Converts EPUB/DOCX to audio
- Uses Google's premium Chirp3-HD voices (sound great!)
- You can choose which chapters to convert
- Shows you the cost before you start
- You use your own Google Cloud account (complete privacy)

**Is this legit?**
Yes! It's the same TTS tech that powers Google Assistant. For genre fiction, it's honestly hard to tell it's AI. Obviously not as good as a professional narrator with character voices, but 90% there for 2% of the cost.

**Who is this for?**
- Testing the audiobook market before investing in professional narration
- Backlist titles that don't justify $2K+ investment
- Non-fiction where expressiveness matters less
- Personal use (converting books you own to audio)

I'm offering launch pricing of $39.99 (normally $49.99) for the first 100 buyers.

Happy to answer questions! I know the self-publishing community is wary of scams, so AMA.
